  // before i realized that's impossible
  // so it's just an abandoned now
  
  // transform it into darkmode.js and just make it the dark theme?
  // universal dark themes already exist
  // yeah just copy one of thhose and turn it into a function to apply it to this
  // so u can just call this for the dark mode button
  // maybe next year when i make the website not look like poop
  // 2023 then, when it hosted on something other than glitch
  // i just need collaborative editor to move to like DO
  // but also DO cost monie so idk
  // we could just have a gh repo lol
  // gh
  // more like slow af prototyping
  // if you want prototyping you can just spin up something on your local machine
  // python3 -m http.server
  
  // but does it affect the currently online server? no

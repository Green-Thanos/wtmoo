  // TODO
  // what is TODO ??
  // this was supposed to be a universal theme generator
  // before i realized that's impossible
  // so it's just an abandoned now
  
  // transform it into darkmode.js and just make it the dark theme?
  // universal dark themes already exist
  // yeah just copy one of thhose and turn it into a function to apply it to this
  // so u can just call this for the dark mode button
  // maybe next year when i make the website not look like poop
  // 2023 then, when it hosted on something other than glitch
  // i just need collaborative editor to move to like DO
  // but also DO cost monie so idk
  // we could just have a gh repo lol
  // gh
  // more like slow af prototyping
  // if you want prototyping you can just spin up something on your local machine
  // python3 -m http.server
  
  // but does it affect the currently online server? no
  // why would you want it to do that wtf
  // // oh embeds
  // also updating is effort
  // here to update i literally just stop typing for 2 seconds
  // i mean you can do the same with github
  // github pages go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
  // wait fuck is this site completely static
  // close enough
  // oh wait im an idiot
  // fml
  // i swear literally apart from calc (that nobody uses) it's 190% static
  // where are you going to host the node app though
  // that actually gens the thing
  // that whats the what
  // inglis pls
  // whats a gen and what thing is it genning
  // well yea this is a node app and you "generate" the site right
  // with like express or whatever and passing fuckin strings of html to that but more or less
  // "generate" but only bc im lazy could just as well plain html
  // also gh has like jekyll
  // how hard would it be to convert this to just generating html files for hosting on gh pages
